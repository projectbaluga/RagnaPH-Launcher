[![.NET Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET%20Framework-4.7.2-512BD4?logo=.net)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

A polished Windows launcher and patcher for **RagnaPH** built with WPF. It displays the latest news, keeps the game files up to date, and launches the client with a single click.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Integrated News Feed** ‚Äì Loads the [RagnaPH news page](https://ragna.ph/?module=news) inside the launcher and strips out navigation and footer elements for a clean look.
- **Automatic Patching** ‚Äì Downloads a remote configuration and sequential patch list to keep the game client current.
- **Progress Feedback** ‚Äì Visual progress bar and status text during patching.
- **One‚ÄëClick Launch** ‚Äì Starts `RagnaPH.exe` directly from the launcher once patching is complete.
- **Fail‚ÄëSafe Messaging** ‚Äì Gracefully reports errors such as missing files, patch failures, or maintenance notices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2019 or later
- **.NET Framework 4.7.2**
- Optional: [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) for experimental builds on other platforms

### Build & Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-user/RagnaPH-Launcher.git
   ```
2. Open the solution file `RagnaPH Launcher.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Restore NuGet packages and build the project.
4. Run the generated executable or press <kbd>F5</kbd> in Visual Studio.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The launcher downloads its behavior settings from a remote `config.ini`. Key values include:

| Section | Key | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| `[Main]` | `allow` | Enable or disable patching |
| `[Main]` | `Force_Start` | Allow launching even if patching is disallowed |
| `[Main]` | `policy_msg` | Message shown when patching is disabled |
| `[Main]` | `file_url` | Base URL for patch files |
| `[Patch]` | `PatchList` | Name of the patch list file |

The patch list is fetched from `file_url + PatchList` and each entry is downloaded relative to the launcher‚Äôs directory.
